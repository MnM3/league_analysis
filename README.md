# About this project

This project aims to harvest data provided from the league of legends client and process it in real time to get valuable insights about the game performance.

## Structure

The project consists of basically important files. One file contains an broad approach on accessing json files and the respective fields. The other is tailored to use those functions and basically wraps the json data and transforms them into data usable by an analysis instance.

## What could have been...

since mid project I lost interest in playing the game this project won't get any updates. But the idea was to take the data and create metrics on performance to give a player insight about his personal performance and gains. There are many tools for League of Legends that do something similar, but the main idea for this tool was to only look into personal performance in real time and leave out a comparison to the general playerbase.
